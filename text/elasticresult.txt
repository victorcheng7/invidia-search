to be quick don't worry and you can follow me on twitter at MX st PR which sounds complicated but it's actually just my name without vowels and i work as an open source developers Inc bell fake mill we are an agency based in Sydney Australia I am NOT from Sydney I'm from Vienna Austria Austria and Australia are not the same country alright just to make sure I work as an open source developer meaning i do lots and lots of open source some of which you might know my most famous project is react boilerplate which is a starter kit for react application that gives you a fully set up environment to start your production ready applications from the second one when i maintain that's quite big is keystone jas which is a no GS content management system for keystone JS we built elemental UI which is a react component library that you can use which it contains things like buttons models spinners so you don't have to care about those things you can just use elemental and they're done and then the last one and the most recent wanna start components which is a new way to style react on applications now i'm here today to talk about react but what is react actually the original tagline that they have on the website said we act is the V in MVC now if you think about that statement what does that even mean how does that make any sense at all it's the Venus of you it's the view in one view controller but then what's the model into controller like what's happening here the whole thing doesn't really make sense and they've actually got rid of that statement from the documentation because react doesn't work in MVC at all there's no model intentional controller recently one of the core authors of react code on Dan Abramoff actually tweeted v's for vanilla so now react is no long is now the vanilla in MPC which makes just about as much sense as before the much better question to ask is why does react exist what does it do what is it made for what's the purpose why should you use react now react was originally sort of created and invented instagram instagram is quite a big app you might probably know it and they have a lot of users and they realize that they the more users they got the more money there to pay because the more users they had and they were rendering things on a server right with some sort of templating language and the more users they got the more service they needed and the more service they needed the more people to administer those service they need it so the more users they got the more expensive everything became and they realize that we're rendering things on a server so we need a lot of service for rendering but what if we just rendered everything on the client right what if we just send wait we just tell the client bought to render and it you know it does it on its own and that's kind of why react was made because rendering a service really expensive but if you rent on the client you don't need as much as many service or as many people that administrating service so actually it's a lot cheaper Instagram must have saved millions of dollars just making reacts and rendering everything client-side right now that's good in the old like you know there's a business case for react but why should you use react what what's the what do you what do you actually use it for dynamic interface this is sort of the thing that react is really good at the thing is dynamic interfaces provide a better user experience for your users because if you think about it imagine every single time you press on the like button on Instagram you would have to do a page refresh like that doesn't make any sense right it's really jarring and users would stop using your app as much so what I hope I having dynamic interfaces where everything happens client-side we if what if done well provide a better user experience for our users now the issue is that dynamic interfaces are really really hard like they're not easy to do there's a lot of logic going on you need to do you need to think and keep track of a lot of different moving parts now react makes dynamic interface is easy that sort of the thing react is really really really good at now to understand why let's take a look at how react works react fundamentally the cool part of react just creates components these components can be anything there are your buttons your models they can be your header your footer they can be everything you want your entire user user interface is structured in components now these components that react creates can then be rendered on these two different targets the interesting thing or an interesting property of react is that the rendering layer is completely separate from the core so normally you would use react on the web right so you'd use react on which is separate package react on to render your components as a website but you could just do well as well write a native app with react and he's react native to render your native components to Android or iOS now that kind of sounds like things like you mana for the framers like ionic or Cordova or those sorts of things right we try to do the whole write once run anywhere thing right but you write your code once and it runs as a website as an iOS app as an Android app whatever you want right you just write your code once but react is not like that react is not write once run anywhere at all reactors learn once write anywhere which is a totally separate idea because in reality when you write some a nap with something like Cordova the issue that you run into is that it's really hard to use the exact exact same code across a lot of different rendering targets right right the exact same code to write to display a nap on the web on Android and on is it's not an easy task with react will you do instead your developers only have to learn react once and then they can write iOS Android and web apps with react and the interesting thing is that reacted because it's all JavaScript react allows you to share a lot of the code I have a friend who works at runtastic which is a startup that was bought by auditors from Austria and runtastic can started integrating react native into their native applications and what they realize is that with react native they can reuse about eighty to ninety percent of their code between Android and iOS while still providing a platform specific experience right so it doesn't feel like a Cordova app that you're running on android and iOS it feels like an Android app and it feels like an hour a SAP on your iPhone but most of the code is shared but there still is like ten percent of the specific parts just some components that do something slightly differently write some material components that look like the Google design for Android learn some you know the tab bar for iOS and that sort of thing but most of the business logic all the data fetching all of that can all be shared in a shared library now I just mentioned components a bunch of times so let's talk about components the web has been around for a long long long time right the first website came out in 1991 as we heard Shep say before and since then things have changed quite a bit right the web was originally envisioned as this network for scientific papers so you'd have your scientific paper on the web and other scientists could read it right everywhere around the world really exciting but that's not what the web is used for any more right we're building really really interactive experiences applications on the web which inherently aren't scientific documents right the whole mental model of documents doesn't work for you know an application let's take a look at an interface that probably many of you look at quite often which is just Google search results right now if you think about this in terms of components what you would do with components here and something like this you'd have a hitter component and the search results compile right that's sort of the thing that we do when you're working with component now this is totally not react specific right if you've ever used them or you have a style guide or you have used object oriented CSS or any of those things that's the exact same thing right it's just it's doesn't matter if you call them blocks or components or whatever you want they're just sort of encapsulated parts of your interface now the interesting thing about components is that they can be composed so components can consist of even more components so if you take a look at this header that could consist of a logo component a search bar components a tab nav component and over there an app struggle and a button right so our header component isn't just one big thing it's composed of smaller components and these smaller components we can then take we use in different parts of our application right because why would you do a different button for every single time we render a button doesn't make any sense just let a button component and reuse it and the thing is we can go even smaller than that right so we take a look at the search by and reality that search bar consists of two things as well it consists of an input and a search icon right and then our tab nav nav isn't just a tad math it also has some tabs right so it has a travel there and you know three more tabs sorry five more tabs formal tabs and then the other ones look like tabs but I actually toggles so if you've ever used the Google search interface those actually aren't tabs those open like dropdowns so we'll just make those a taco component and the thing is we could go on and on and on with this right but every interface is sort of built up from the mentally of tiny encapsulated parts that you can reuse and react really encourages building your interfaces like that now let's take a look at what components look like in react and what I show some code here I know it's quite late but the words not a lot of code react has this very fundamental function which is called react or create elements and that's actually most of react if you understand react or create element you understand a very big part of react now reacted create elements creates Dom nodes so if we say react the creative and render that with react Dom what we get is a div one who would have thought very interesting the same thing is of course true if we say h1 or if we say input or whatever element we want you can even run a custom elements like this you can you can bring the web components with react which is really interesting but i'm totally not going to get into today so we have to create elements create elements now elements sometimes have attributes right and input what if we want to make this a radio button right we would have to set type radio' reactive create element has a second argument which is an object so in our case we can just say react to create element input then I pass an object and say the type should be radio and then if we render that with react on what we get this input type radio' who would have thought let's go a bit further and look at another example in this case we create a heading now headings normally have some sort of text right and you probably want to add a class to that class name is a bit of an interesting one he react because in ruin javascript class is now a reserved keyword right as a v6 if you name a variable class javascript is going to throw an error and tell you what are you doing like classes a reserved keyword you can't do that so in react if you want to say set the class of an element you actually have to call it class name because class is a reserved keyword that's one of two or three inconsistencies between react and the dom and we'll get to what that actually means later on but just for now if you want to set the class of an element you say class name forget about it now the text we just passes the third argument right just take H one class i'm heading and then pass in the text to the world now the interesting thing about these elements is that this last argument where we now say hello world can also be other elements so we could wrap this heading in a div by just calling reactor core element another time so what I just did there is I just wrapped the reactor 3 element h1 in a reactor trade element div and that's just you know an element that renders another element if we wanted to set a class on that if you just pass you know some properties to our this element now the thing is this div class name wrapper right we actually kind of want to reuse this because it's our wrapper and it should be the same on every page that we have right every page should have the same break points which are defined with the wrapper class name so how do we extract this to be sort of a common thing it's just JavaScript so we can just make it a function right so we can say akon strapper equals function and then it gets as props which we'll get to very soon never save react return reactor create element is class name wrapper and then notice where we're before we said react to create element if we not just say react to create element rapper now if you read through this code you'll actually notice that a problem we don't see our heading where we rendered with the reactant it's not a type one is live if you see if you try doing it like this this is not going to show the heading and the reason is that what we now do with this reactor core element rapper call is recreate a component and components get this props very which is the properties of the component now this is a argument that our component gets passed here which is our heading doesn't get attached anywhere what we need to do is we need to tell react to take the children that our component gets passed and pass them on to the Dom so watch closely what we do appear is we just say props the children as a third argument and suddenly we have the hitting again that was just a lot of explanation for a very fundamental principle which is that components get whatever you pass them as properties or as children as the arguments they don't do anything magically it's just dollar scoop right so you have to take care of attaching the children to the actual Dom node again so that's just what we act components looks like it's just functions now react has a very special property this property is that it's very fast now that's because rendering the whole DOM is really really slow and if you have some sort of interactive application where you can draw for example and you would trash the entire tongue bomb every time something changes that would be horrendously slow like you would never have 60 frames per second like at all so react does is it creates a representation of the Dom so when you save react to create element that doesn't just go ahead and say okay document dot appendchild h2 but it actually does is it creates a representation of the dome all right and that sounds kind of weird so let's let's take a look at what that actually means when we say react or create element h1 what react creates is an object right and that object says just type h1 props class i'm heading and then children hello world but it just you know it's just a mapping from that function to an object and then if we would wrap that again in a div what reactors does is it creates another object to run it right so we would say an object with the type of rapper props of nouns and children is an array where the first element is second are heading element now this is a tree structure right you can um miss this is deep or as high up as you want and the thing is we act creates this huge object for your entire representation of the dawn that's not useful in the first render right the first time we render you your page but react is going to do is going to go through your tree and create all the elements based on what you said but where it gets really really really useful is when you do changes because what react does is on every tick on every time something changes it calculates the changes between the previous representation and the current representation of the DOM and it can do that because objects right it's just looping through objects and nested objects right well it does it just loop through two objects and check if the the fields are the same and if they aren't those changes now take a look at this sort of tiny objects that we just saw and don't blink because I'm going to change something all right boom there we go did you see what changed it wasn't very fancy right what changed is just the text right we just changed the text now what we act does is it goes in and it compares these two trees it loops through every single property and value and goes ok we have the previous representation of the dorm and now something's changed so it we have the new representation of the Dom so what exactly are the differences it just checks that it just figures it out and then when it's done that what it does is it only renders the changes to the Dom it doesn't trash the entire dorm and rearranges everything just because a tiny thing changed it just rerun it's a tiny part right you've just changed the text so let's just take out the text and put in the new text right that's it and that's why react is really really really fast now if you've ever seen react code you might have heard of something called jsx which is HTML kind of in your JavaScript that sounds really weird but I'm going to show you why it's useful so if we take a look at this code again it's sort of readable right if you if you really concentrating you read through this you realize ok so he created Eve with a classroom of rap and so you can sort of map that code to the HTML that this will actually render right but it's sort of a bit tedious now well if we could just replace our reactor create element heading cool with this right suddenly to look clearer what that will render to DOM right compared to previously which is where just said reactor 3 element h1 it now actually kind of looks like HTML right so just by looking at this I already know ok it's going to render an h1 with a class of hating and with the texture fellow world right I don't think about it it's just that's going to render that HTML on there obviously now we can do the same thing inside our component right our reactor core element div code which is replaced with a div with a class of rapid rate as its children it's as simple as that now where it gets really interesting is when you start rendering components like this so our reactor create element rapper call we can actually just replace with rapper right because you know all we do here is we create an element that meant as a rapper so let's just replace it with rapper now look at this and then look at what this renders it done right now compared to what we had previously this is pretty tedious to read but if you look at this I know exactly what this is going to Venice at all it's a lot clearer to work that way now it does require a bit of special tooling right you need to transpile this syntax to react to create element thing so you need some sort of you need to do something like bubble which is a tool like transpose your javascript but for that you don't have to use it a and B if you do use it what you get is a lot more clearer code now just a few minutes ago I launched something entirely new which is a course where you can learn reacts interactively in your browser so this teaches you everything from react and Redux to so state management / testing of immutable data structures in JavaScript do you everything you need to know to build an actual react application you can go to this too with this tinyurl MXN studies / msds react and there's a code that i made actually just for you so if you use the code a you react launch you get sixty percent of the entire course right and it teaches you everything you need to know in your browser so let's play ground you have multiple we have multiple files it literally feels like writing an app except you don't need to set up anything on it on your laptop it runs on your phone if you want to you want to hold on your tablet while you're on the go totally works and yeah that was pretty much the Shoeless overview of react I've ever done so enjoy your beer I guess thank you for having me do you have any questions um if you ask a question be sure to know that you're probably gonna get linked by everybody else who just wants to drink beer but I mean if you want to go ahead with that true I'm just kidding if you have any questions I'm around as well yeah it's a question like that yeah a very brave so you know who to beat up later right he is he signing now he's standing in between you and your peers just saying sorry did I ever make no I don't even know that is I'm sorry I can't answer that question any other questions no well they enjoy your beer have a great evening [Applause]

","timestamp":"0:29:20","duration":"4.43","startIndex":26716,"endIndex":26750}],"transcript":"thanks so much Devin thanks to heavy bit and treasure data for setting this up so my name is Sasha I used to be the CTO at Redfin I've been recently I've been fun employed and I've been traveling and playing a lot with react and I'm excited to show you some stuff I've worked on so we tend to think to set the stage we tend to think of react as a browser tool or for those of you using react native is a client tool but it's really important on the server as well and I mean actually the fact that react has server-side rendering was the thing that originally attracted me to it you know we were using you know complicated client-side JavaScript at Redfin and we had a lot of trouble with SEO it's very difficult you can make a JavaScript mostly JavaScript site SEO compatible but it's very buggy it's very difficult and it just wasn't giving us the speed we wanted and so you know react on the server is really about getting speed getting the building HTML down to the client as soon as possible so the user really gets a great experience but too often it's kind of slow on a server I don't know how many of you have tried it have played around with it but it can be kind of slow so let's do a little demo so I'm going to be going through a demo a really simple benchmark this is the the the component I'm going to be rendering it's a very simple component call it recursive divs and it just generates a giant tree of divs takes two properties a depth and a breadth at depth zero it just returns a simple little div with like 10 characters and if depth is higher than zero it recursing in an array of children also puts on and on click handler just for fun but other than that it's pretty simple so this is just a very simple component that can show you giant component trees we have a benchmark function here and this is also pretty simple this is just a file that's exporting a method to be benchmarked and all it's doing is just calling the getting read I try react Dom server and calling rendered a string with a depth of 4 and a breadth of 11 so let's run that and see what that looks like I'm using benchmark Jas for the for the renderer for the benchmarking so it takes a little while especially in the first one because it's kind of slow to get statistical significance I picked the depth and breadth it's a pretty big it actually makes a pretty big document it's about 900 kilobytes but I was actually and that may sound like oh my god that's huge but the other day I was looking at like the Facebook newsfeed the Twitter feed and just when you load the Twitter feed it's over one megabyte of HTML in your browser so 900 kilobytes is not actually that crazy all right so it took over a second to generate that page that's really really bad performance that's not good right we can't have a server that's taking a whole second to generate the HTML and you know most giving one hit per second so let's see what we can do about that first off just stepping back why does speeds suffer and react server I think there are three basic reasons first off renders string it's running a node it's single threaded it's single CPU it's synchronous these are all things that are going to make it it's CPU bound and you know Moore's Law has been holding and servers have been getting faster but mostly in multi-core not in single core right single core performance actually hasn't been getting much better over the years it's giving a little better you know bit by bit the other reason I think react on the server often is not as fast as you'd like it to be is that server rendering and client rendering share the exact same code path this is really great for code reuse and I understand why the engineers working on it did it but there's a ton of stuff that you have to do for the client that you don't have to do for the server things like keeping track of a virtual DOM there's no reason to have a virtual Dom on the server keeping track of all the event handlers no reason to have those on the server and yet it has to do all that code and the last reason I mean the core reason really I think is that Facebook isn't using it as production at least as far as I can tell and I say this not to not to cast any shade at Facebook I think Facebook is amazing I think it's amazing that they open sourced react and it's a really really cool product and I think it's actually amazing that they put this feature in that's really important that they don't actually get much benefit out of but they more or less said at the react conference when somebody asked about performance in server-side rendering that they don't use it so they don't prioritize it as much as they might if they did and but the cool thing is that means that we get to work on it and make it better so I'm going to tell you six weird tricks to improve the performance of your server a react server click disclaimer though I'm talking about the amount of time it takes to generate the HTML which is really only a small part of how your webpage you know your web page performance looks there's lots of other stuff going on in the web in your web app you know loading java script loading CSS yada yada yada if you haven't read these three books on web performance just don't even listen to the rest of my talk download them start reading them now because anything you tips I tell you will be absolutely useless unless you follow the things that these folks tell you first all right so my best try at a click Beatty title for this talk six weird tricks okay the first one doesn't isn't really weird I bet 90% of the people in the room know it it's production mode okay this is pretty obvious but it's super important if you don't use it it's really bad all you have to do is just set node end to production let's see what that does in our little test here all right we run that and this is going to run a little faster while we're waiting for that I'm just curious how many people here use react on the server side okay actually more than I thought nice um and who here use it for SEO Wow like one oh no ok for you three or four all right uh 263 milliseconds so that's about four times faster okay clearly that's an obvious good win why is that well it turns out one of the things that's really great about react as a developer is that there's a ton of good error messages and react and really thoughtful I think intensively sort of helpful error messages but they're really expensive to do all those checks for the error messages so running a production mode doesn't do it you know basically cuts out all of that code and it's actually spending you know three-quarters of its time just in developer warnings so that's a simple one downsides to the production mode there basically aren't any let's move on all right weird trick number to use the minified version of react that's packaged for the browser now you may have heard you may have read on stack overflow you may have seen on various things like no you shouldn't you don't have to minify code for dot node and in a general sense that's true but it actually really helps with react and I'll talk about why in a moment first I'm just going to say how do you do it it's pretty simple all you have to do is just change the import or if you're using require change the require from react dom / server to react dist react min this points at if you're using the npm version of react this points at the browser minified browser distribution of react and let's demo that I say demo but this is really just coding and running the thing over and over again okay react dot min it's that simple we'll run this okay so of I'm curious of the people who are using react on the server how many new about using the browser version all right nice and right here okay we got a couple people I'm hoping I hope is I get a one tip that stumps everybody okay that cut off about seven milliseconds out of the 260 it tends to give in my tests about a 30% to cut off about 30% of the performance why is that do you think the crazy thing is the may it's once again it seems to be those developer warnings and it's actually we cut out the developer warnings by moving by running in production mode but it still has to check whether it's in production mode and it turns out in node for whatever reason chest checking process end node end is really expensive so it spends about a third of its time just checking if it's in production mode and skipping the code crazy there's a bit of bug on this in in the react repo for two years now I think they might fix it in 15 and make this the automatic thing to happen in production mode but I'm not sure downsides to this makes a server harder to bug removes a lot of great dev warnings don't do it in dev but products pretty good third Babel transforms so there were two Babel transforms everyone knows a Babel is yes cool to Babel transforms added in react 14 that one of them is called constant react elements and the other one is called inline react elements and they're both for performance so the constant elements transform finds JSX in your code that is actually always going to evaluate to the same thing that has no variables in it and it will hoist that JSX to a higher scope assign it to a variable and then use the variable inside where where that JSX used to be okay this example might help explain you have a component here if you run the constant element transform on it it will see that that a JSX right there the fubar and it will pull it into a higher a variable outside the scope so now when render runs the JSX doesn't have to run before the JSX was running it was calling react create element every time render was called now it isn't the inline element transform actually takes JSX and JSX normally transforms into the call react create element at runtime what the inline transform does is it actually does that call essentially at Build time and puts in and replaces your JSX with the object that would have been the result of react create element as an example the inline transform would find that and replace it with this crazy hell of objects that you don't want to see but luckily you don't have to to do this you just have to install the two babel plugins the hardest part is remembering the names of these I swear and then you have to add these to your babel config that should actually be plugins not presets and just trust me constant elements has to be before inline elements let me go ahead and demo that right now I'm going to pull up my babel RC which is my babel config file and we're going to test my typing skills here transform constant nope constant elements transform react inline elements okay sorry thank you I love having cheerful folks now I'm guessing the folks who knew about the browser one knew about the Bible transforms right no okay oh I got one yeah I'm excited um all right we'll see ya should almost be done all right yeah so this one in my experience only shaves about maybe 10% off the performance not amazing but certainly worth it it's not it's not very hard to do also as a side note those of you who aren't doing react react server rendering both of those transforms can be used for client-side and help the performance of client-side as well all right downsides of it requires a babel build step but almost every react project right now these days has a babel build step so that probably isn't much of a downside all right weird trick number four avoid create class turns out components with that are created with react create class significantly slower than es6 components and stateless components and I'm just going to go ahead and demo that this is a little bit of a longer one let's this is this is one of the fun ones to see if I can really know so right here I've got one that's with a traditional react create class and I'm going to change it to an es6 class change that to class change this to extends react component then get rid of function because he needs that get rid of a comma because commas are evil here to fuck function get rid of that and then one thing that's that you can easily miss when you do this is that in react dot create class components everything is auto bound and so you have to make sure you bind your element handlers when you switch them over to es6 components cuzzy has six components methods are not auto bound to the instance alright let's save that and back to our trusty thing so can I ask who knew this as a performance tip oh right I haven't seen it a nice I haven't seen it published anywhere I I just I tried it on a whim frankly alright yeah right it's crazy I love that like my demo is 66 like being typed up in courier and be like whew okay uh why does this why does this happen honestly I don't know and I haven't had time to figure it out uh I have a suspicion with no data I suspect the auto-binding but I'm not sure and I just haven't had time to look into it I've been hacking around um alright so we've gotten it down from over a second 266 milliseconds which is pretty darn good but I wanted to see if we could do better oh sorry first the downsides of doing es6 classes it can be a lot of work to trance to change your code from one form to the other it's relatively mechanical work but it is bug prone especially the auto bound handler so be really careful also one downside some people hate es6 classes with a fire of a thousand suns I don't understand it but if you're one of those that's a huge downside for this okay so weird trick number five streaming so one of the things that browsers are actually shockingly good at is dealing with fragments of HTML documents we often think that that we have to generate an entire document and then send it down to the browser but that's not how what browsers are expecting browsers are really used to HTML being sort of trickled down from the network and they're able to they're really good at displaying and rendering partial documents and you can use this to your benefit for example imagine you were in charge of Google's results page maybe somebody here is and this this you know and somebody sends you a query they want the search results page with the term react you could serve them up this header without talking to your back-end at all right you could you could start sending them down HTML with this with this header because it has no information about how many search results or what the search results are it's just basically static information that you already know so you can send off an asynchronous request your back-end to find out the search results at the same time that you're sending HTML down to the front-end and the browser will display this and the user will think that the page is loading even though it isn't totally loading it's only partially loading so the user will actually see this and if your back end is hiccupping for some reason they'll see this and they'll sort of think oh it's there before they get the actual results and I know that um I know that Yahoo you did this for a long time and I think Google did it as well with Instant Search I think they may not do it as much as a venue for those of you want to know more about this this is called chunked encoding it's been part of HTTP since 1999 I think it is a it's supported in every browser you can possibly imagine it is criminally underused I think as a as a performance enhancer for sites that you can stream down HTML you don't have to generate the whole page framework after frame work forces you to generate the whole page before they send information down it's just not great however for for react we know that react Dom's rendered a string just returns a fully rendered string right that's not going to help us because it does render the entire the entire document and then you send it down so I went and made a library called react Dom stream I released this maybe two or three months ago and it's a fork of react the of a fork of react 14 that adds a bunch of not a bunch it adds basically a render method that outputs a stream instead of a string so let's talk about so the cool thing about it is that time to first byte when you use react Dom stream stays constant as the content length gets longer and longer so you can generate a you know 20 megabyte HTML page and it still only takes a few milliseconds to get that first first bite out of the render tree time to last bites obviously scales with how long how big the content is but it scales more or less linearly and it takes about the same amount of time as react on okay so if you want to use react downstream how do you do it first you have to install it from NPM obviously then you need to change your import statements it's really simple it's just react Dom stream server I tried to make it as similar to react on as possible then you need to change your calls your render to string calls to return a stream what that might look like is something like this this would be an express route where you got res dot send wants to take in a string instead you just pipe it out to to the response because in express responses are streams this is theirs it's a little more complicated than this because you probably want to put HTML and you know body tag around it and so you have to tell it not to end this dream but this is basically what it looks like all right let's see if I can do the live coding on this one I am not entirely convinced all right the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to import a little thing I call timing stream which is just a really simple stream that throws away the bits but omits two different events a start event when it gets its first bite and a finish event that every stream emits when it gets that last Bice last bite so now instead of rendering to string I output to a stream I'm going to pipe it to a new timing stream and then on start which is when the first bite comes in I'm going to do something and this is where things get a little funky because we have to make this this test is now going to be asynchronous we have to tell the test when it finishes and then we'll unpack the stream okay and that looks pretty good then we catch me make a mistake speak now all right and I'm going to do it twice once we start and once with finish because I actually want to test both things because now we've got sort of two moments we're looking at when the first bite comes in TT FB and TTL be under - all right does that seem oh I have to say that they're deferred tests and there's one more thing I need to do what is it thank you change the import react dumb stream server that seemed right to people st. pay paying attention all right we'll see I count on you all to watch out for me all right has anybody heard of react on stream oh you're my favorite person all right all right so first bike came in four milliseconds last bike came in 62 milliseconds so you notice the last bite actually came in before the full thing did the full string came from react Dom and the first bike came in four milliseconds that's awesome we can get we can get the the mark-up down to the browser as quickly as possible when you think about it this makes sense I mean rearranger is just is is doing a depth-first traversal of this tree it should be able to start outputting really almost immediately okay so that's pretty cool um let's look at so downsides to this to using streaming first off its beta you know and it's made by some guy I can totally vouch for that dude um no I mean he's shifty so you need to decide what your risk tolerances I would say it's not like moving everything to es6 classes it's not as I don't think it's as likely to cause bugs and it's pretty easy to revert like you saw I was just changing the stream just back to string and changing the import another thing that to watch out for is intervening HTTP proxies between your server and your user are actually allowed to coalesce the the the response and basically stop the streaming and we had like months on phone calls with a CDN I shall not name trying to convince them that streaming HTML was a normal thing chunked encoding so just be careful of that that especially you have a CDN in front all right last yeah when we hold questions for the end how about last last weird trick trick number six cache components okay so I wanted to see if it could get even better than that like four bytes four milliseconds to the first buys grades but still sixty-two last and center way we could do better and so I started thinking about caching and you know caching on the server has traditionally been this really difficult really messy thing I mean it's it always starts out really simple you're like oh I'm doing the New York Times the newspaper is just the newspaper I can just cash it right and it'll look great for everyone but then you're like wait if I cash it for a few minutes well these are ads that really should be different for every person and oh there's this stock market thing that needs to be updated every few seconds and it actually includes the person's login menu so that needs to not be cached and actually maybe this whole layout is part of an a/b test and there's multiple of them if I catch them I'll destroy the a/b test because it turns out page level caching is just really bad idea right and this is always what happens when you try and do page level caching but react is really good at breaking pages down into smaller more reusable pieces and I was thinking be really cool if we had component level caching um and so if you use if you do that sort of immutable state functional programming thing people like to think about react and if you think about react components as props and state just a simple pure function of props and state that maps to a string when it's on the server just mapping to a string that should be that's you know as a functional programmer you just think oh we can just cash those we can memorize them like that's what if it's if it's a pure function with no side effects we should be able just to catch this so I went ahead and hacked this into react on stream last week so if you want to use it install the beta you really should use it uh and then you need to add a cache object to the read string method it looks something like this I'm going to go pretty quickly through this just add a cache to the end of that render the string and then you need to actually have your component opt in because it's really dangerous to cache if you don't have the right cache key you know so basically you have to implement this method in your component called component cache key which outputs a string and that string has to include all of the properties that are used as inputs to the render method this is because you have to do this for the cache because otherwise you could we could end up you know getting false cache hits which is really bad so it's really important that you explicitly tell the framework all of the things that are going to be part of your render method inputs into your render method let's do a quick demo of that how do I do this what's this all right so the first thing I'm going to import the LRU render cash from react Dom stream LRU render cache const cache 1 equals new and I will say this API is very new as of a few days ago it is liable to change if you want to use it let me know and we'll talk about it because I think it's kind of a neat idea but it has not been used in production and what could possibly go wrong all right so you add the cache as an option optional argument at the end of the render to string we created the caches here and now we need to go over to the component and we need to add that method I said which is a component cache key which I think needs a better name now this component is really simple all it needs is it only depends on its depth and breadth and it's a pure function of those two variables so I'm just going to do something simple and say stringify this dot props that should give a cache key that will be unique for every different rendering of the component alright now I know nobody's heard of this one because I've literally told no one you ready to be amazed are you ready to be amazed I'm ready alright so yeah hold your applause I'm cheating I mean not seriously I mean this is I mean that recursive dibs thing you give it a props a depth and a breadth it gets in the cache the first render and it just pulls it from the crash the second render like it's it's this is the best possible case for for caching but I still think it's pretty cool and it has I think a lot of potential um it has some downsides right Alpha quality already said that nobody's tried in production nobody knows about it as with all caches if it has a low hit rate you know if you if you're you know if you are rendering things that are totally different all the time or your components are getting different props all the time caching is just giving in that negative it's just going to be a drag on the system it's also super dangerous caching on the server has this problem I don't know how many of you saw what happened to steam on Christmas yeah right so those of you don't know steam had a bunch of problems and you know there ops people god bless them we're having terrible problems and they made a mistake in trying to bring their systems back up and they miss configure to cache and then people started getting other people's account pages because they went to the account page and they got a cached version which is bad so if you get the cache key wrong that cache key method can serve personal data to the wrong person this is true with any does not just this you know this component this is any kind of server caching all right so recap of my 6 weird trip tips should I use these that's a good question um some production mode yeah you already should have been minified react from the browser yes I think it's really easy it gives a ton of performance babel transforms don't give a lot of performance but they're really easy to do um yes six classes in stateless components maybe that's one where you really have to say how much work is it going to be are there maybe like three components that are used all the time throughout my render trees and so it's be a small amount of work but it can really introduce bugs streaming once again I wrote it but maybe um you know I think it's really cool and I would love for people to try it out and if you try it out please let me know so I can find out about how it's working for you um but you know it's it's definitely more beta caching probably not yet if you want to work with me and make it better that's great and I think there's lots of things that can be done to make it better but I wouldn't use in production yet and that's it thank you so much

it looks like we are going there and we are life just wait a few second and bear with me I set up a few things so let me just quickly handle things ok so I think now the audio should be perfect and we are live I think everybody can receive the feed that I'm saying in here ok I'll just close it down ok hey everybody just say hi if you are there I know this is not the best thing in here the quality is not so awesome but we are going we are doing something there ok just say hello there and let me know if everybody is ready to rock and roll with react jeez hey everybody hey I met hey hey there gaming Mohan safwan Akash so hey everybody it's being awesome that some of you are already waiting I love that ok so some of you might be experiencing a little bit of the buffer there let me just go on to some place else so that let me know if the things are good and just bid wait with me bear with me for a few second I need to add just a few things and pop-out chat that would be awesome so chat is now they're with us and i think i need to put it there and yep i think i can stop my buffering there and there we go ok hey everybody hey everybody quite a lot of people are joining in so current is theirs after is there Technine sonic praveen hey everybody and good evening to you all of you thank you so much for taking some time and going out in here to learn react you are true learner guys so hey everybody and give it a thumbs up and say can we proceed right just there if we can proceed with react GS react j/s okay so your core data in table view video was awesome thank you so much right now let's just focus on react i hope i will learn something new in every single day don't worry about that with with in here you are definitely going to learn something meaningful something awesome okay so increase video quality and surprisingly i cannot do much about the video quality is there frame rates are dropping quite a lot let me just see if I can fix it okay just give me a second there if I get live streaming with that's such a condition there such a slow internet I don't know it's something okay and yep I can understand the live streaming is not so good and there is no other internet provider who can give me fast internet there and so yep there will be a little bit buffering but everybody is saying yes so I think we can now move on okay so let me quickly give you a few introduction about react j/s and okay I need to block a few people as well so let me just and let me remove this guy okay don't worry okay and let's just write it okay so in case some of you might be new here with the reactors let me just quickly introduce their and directly from there we are going to move into react GS code session okay so react GS is a library or framework whatever you like to call it is being developed by the facebook and okay what are the prerequisite before learning react i would say HTML CSS and basics of java script what basics you should be able to write a function and a loop in react in Jas and I think you should be ready to rock and roll there wouldn't be much i will be explaining each and every code that will be writing okay no big deal there okay let's just go in here and this is all about the reactant case you want to know much much more about it get started is the place where you might want to go and there we all we are not going to look much into the docs in here because I'm quite quite friendly with the react now and before they're the prerequisite that everybody should have in case you have subscribed to my mailing list i have already thrown up a few emails in case you did subscribe it really late I throw it up the email around 7pm in case you subscribe after that no problem in the upcoming live code sessions you will be getting all of these emails okay so the requirement number one is you should have no Jas I do have my node.js there and if I just open up a terminal there and hope you need to basically have no dan den p.m. with the node NPM automatically comes in so I can just give you a note version this is the version on which I am if you are on a backward version no problem at all there won't be much difference in here and NP MV to give NPM version there we go no big deal so far it's good now I also asked you to install react so in case some of you are already here they might be knowing how to clear how to create a boilerplate code all you have to do is these commands npm install hyphen G create react app so basically what you are doing is you are installing the react app there globally and if you're in the windows again you can do so and in the windows make sure you open up the terminal by administrator in the mac make sure you use sudo before this command okay and after that you can run create react app and you can simply say hello world so hello world will be the name of your project and let's create a very fresh project so that a lot of you can follow me up so I am on my desktop and I think I should create a new folder there and mkdir and let's call it live do a quick LS let's go into live there okay that's good I'm just creating a folder no fancy stuff on this terminal there okay and let's just simply create react app and let's call it as here too because we will be fetching a lot of api's from the youtube there okay and in the meantime it gets installed there it's going to take a little bit of the time not much let me just uh keep a popping of the questions in case you want to ask other things as well you can throw up the questions I'm ready to have a talk with you and in case you are following me up give me a follow their so right follow in case you are doing exactly the same in here and of course the course this entire life will be available to everybody to watch afterwards as well no problem at all okay and yep a lot of people are watching and that is good thing surprisingly there are enough people who wants to learn and that is good and some of you might be experiencing buffering as well and let me know now if the quality is good okay it's fetching up some data taking a little bit of the time in case you want to ask anything else about the react jessie you can just post all your questions and we are going to make an appt let me in the meantime I'll show you what kind of app we are going to build up okay it's not there let me open up a new terminal there and new tab would be good okay so it's on my desktop and let me just run the app don't worry about the commands and everything we will be working on the commands and everything later on right now just I am showing you what kind of project that we are building up okay there we go our server loads up there are pretty easy no big deal there and don't worry we'll walk walk you through with everything in here okay so it's taking a little bit of the time again internet is an issue and that is why I usually record everything there okay so it's good now this is the app that we will be building up and basically there is nothing much going on with the app it's pretty easy as soon as you click on this get youtube videos it gets the YouTube videos my last top 10 videos you don't need to do anything manually it just fetches out my last 10 videos or from my channel so that's what we will be building up in the mean way we will be learning about the get the api's of the YouTube and how to fetch in how to do automatically and by the way we could have done the same thing simply add the reload of the page I'll talk about that as one but that is good in here okay and I would request all of you to keep the topic of the discussion as react as we are talking about the react there so make sure you just keep the things with the react okay and no need ask what is react Jess and what we can do with it react GS is is a good tool to design web apps and even mobile apps as well you can design fast loading websites with no load at all whether react you can further move on to create a iOS and Android app with the reactor as well no need to learn anything like Java or so if you can just code everything in the react okay I'm not getting it can you explain it a little bit more yes surely i will explain let me know what at what point you are stuck we haven't started the project yet we are just stuck there okay it's taking time and we had just fetching the directories and everything in here we haven't started anything in here okay already passed on 10 minutes okay I would again request all of you to just please keep discussion okay so just wait for a few seconds there it's okay i'm just reading out a few comments by the way and there we go and we are ready to rock and roll now so everything is done we can just move into the directory there and i can close this guy we don't need it so let me just close this we don't need extra terminal and this is the project that we will be building up I hope everybody now knows where we are moving let's go in here so let's just quickly do a this come commands there so we'll move on to youtube and do a quick LS now it says NPM start now what it has done with this create react app is it has created some boilerplate code that you can directly use and it was also installed some of the script so that you can run directly NP and start and can go in there okay so let me just go into this YouTube and now I'll just run NPM start okay and there we go and this is the boilerplate code that it gives up don't worry it's getting reloaded so this is the basic starting point of all of our apps okay and I'll just close down the server in a sec for a second I'll run my atom there okay so let's just go in here and this is the code where we will be writing over all of our code okay so I'll just minimize it there a little bit and moving it aside there I think this is all we need and let's just run our terminal there and let's just run this it's simply NPM start okay and within a few seconds we'll be ready to write some code there and there we go I think it's ready yep looks like let's just quickly do a reload no it's not ready yet it will be ready in a second no big deal there and there we go now it's good happy and ready to rock and roll okay so we are ready to rock and roll there so this is going on now in the meantime let me quickly explain you what the structure of the react just looks like inside the public folder you get an index dot HTML which most of the time you don't touch you everything right everything inside the SRC folder there and mostly in the apt GS now again a lot of people like to just code a few things in their separate components and new folders we are not here to talk about that how the MVC models and everything should look like how the components should be placed into a separate folder but what we are going to do let me increase our other things in here and let me just close a few things so that you can get better reception there let me just try to work on there and where is my software there we go okay so there we go I'm trying to remove myself from okay let me just remove myself okay i think the latency should be better now you will be able to see the code better there okay okay so i think this is good and the strill the streaming is lagging behind a little bit ok so let's move on and try to go in there and I think things should be good now okay I don't know why this is happening but we are not getting the best streaming there ok let me know everybody that how you are viewing experiences right now I think you might be seeing some delays there some buffering there but i think it's it's ok ok let's just go in there and let me now again is it okay okay so can we move on and proceed there okay so it is good somebody has replied at least okay now let's go ahead and create our first component in case if you are aware with the react there there we go now we are going to create our very first component there in case you don't know what that is react actually divides everything into component in the pieces they're breaking down so let's create our very first component I would like to get rid of this paragraph we don't need it so how do we create actually a component now right click on the source file and click on the new file we want to create a new file inside the SRC okay and i'll call this as YouTube dot GS now the convention here is to use a capital letter there okay this is how we do this stuff hit enter and there we go so I know some of you might be facing a little bit of the issues with the streaming I know I this is the only fastest internet I could get in here if anybody can help me to get more faster internet in Jaipur I would be thankful to him okay let me try to adjust some settings there and I think this is the best we can do there I know streaming is really really bad there a lot of frames are okay you cannot read the stuff there ok and ok so this is why it's getting a little bit bad there let me try to write a few things in here import react from and we need one more actually react and components and there we go and how is it now can you read the stuff okay we are facing a lot of issues in here with the streaming there okay so we have created our component there and we are just trying to go in here the component is basically just a class that we are going to have so there we go and these are the few things that I have stored in my snippets there you have to write all of it like there is a class and after the class there should be a name that is going to be YouTube which extends component and then we have a method there render and which returns just one element make sure you understand that okay so I think can we proceed everybody is there telling here if you are falling ok can't read the stuff ok now this is bad ok looks like okay let me know how the quality is going on i can see that the live stream r is having a big issues there and it's not able to do any kind of stuff there now it's visible but not in good quality okay and I think it's not that much working good because I'm actually rendering everything in HD high quality I always do everything in the high quality but this is not working anyhow yep it's really a bad streaming there it's showing me health issues and really I think with just eight mbps it's really pathetic speed in here I'm not able to okay so should i should i quit it in here and post a video of this react instead that would be good I think okay or can we continue in here let me know if we should continue or should I make a video and post it there totally on you if you'll ask me to continue in here I'll just live is the best idea ok so I think we should continue in here and i'll post videos later on ok so let's complete this app just notifying but in the comments section just post live just post something like go live or go video so what's your option should i go live or should i post a video later on okay it's working fine so a lot of thing okay let's continue ok so let's go in here and try to go there okay go live everybody's inserted in live go live so okay okay so what we are doing in here let's go there oh yeah for sure i'll upload the videos there as well no problem at all go live okay everybody everybody I got that let's go live okay and let's go at it in here so what we are doing in here let me increase the font size in case that helps a little bit so what we're trying to do in here is create a component there and we have created a component there and one thing that you need to understand with the reactors you can only return one component that's it there is no other option like if you want to return a component that says takes to the division or maybe something else you cannot do so you just need to return anything and one of the trick or I would say one of the way of handling the things in here is you just create a big division and return everything inside it and basically the thing that you see in here is not not the HTML it's actually jsx that you might already be familiar some of you it looks exactly just with their so let's just go in here and do some things okay now what we want to do in here is we want to some sale let's just say hello there and there we go and we want to import this into our apt GS so how do we do that how we import a component there okay so we're going to simply say import and we're going to name it as header now make sure that you do one thing in here that I forgot almost forgot is that you can do you have to do actually you cannot do you have to export that as well expo default header so whatever the name of your class is not the header in this case youtube so whatever your class name is you have to export that as well so that you can use it in some other class as well for example in here I want to use it I'll say import header from and then I'll say oops not the header why I'm writing header again and again maybe I worked with some file just now from a header and you don't need to write Jas and everything it's automatically being good in here so there we go this is good for us right now and how do we import a component there so we import a component simply by doing a header and make sure it's a self closing tag okay without this it's not going to be good and as soon as I save this ah it's not the header why I'm writing header again again I'd no idea so just write the YouTube whatever you are importing save that and we are facing an error so module header okay I have no idea why I'm writing header and header again okay and let's just save that and hit a quick reload module YouTube not found how can you do that and we are having a YouTube here having issue there so there we go i think it's good now and let us see if we are getting it okay that is good let me just copy and paste that if I'm making some mistake there and there we go and save that and i think my npm is running and it's not finding youtube why is it not finding youtube okay a lot of people are asking questions but it will be a good option I think so if it here will be a good option because things are going super mess in here it's not downloading any file it's not doing any live streaming they're no good at all and what mistake we are making in here okay let me just import it where is a very YouTube door GS file oops I forgot to write one thing what am i doing that's / there ok now it's good it says hello there so you saw so programming is all about debugging your things and if you're not good in debugging then it's not going to happen you need to learn how to debug so light coating is all about problems that we have okay yeah internet speed really broke the momentum there sharada it's really bad and it's I don't like to just be on a slow internet I'm not that much capable yes you can make fully native apps with react native no problem at all okay so i think we can move on it's really unbearable speed they're totally unbearable okay so let me know it's it's completely silent in here let me type in here as well I think we cannot go like this let me know what are your thoughts i think i would probably record this record this on on a video that would be better because right now it's not at all working it's no good idea and people are asking what language are you programming ok for some people it's working and let me know how the things are going on should we move I think we should move on and close this lie because it's not at all working I cannot see a real-time experience with a react there and I thought it would be a good thing to just a watch code and code along with me but I think it's not working ok so recording will be better and you thanks for joining in everyone and in case those who are thinking what why I'm not speaking anything it's because i'm chatting in here as well ok i am stopping the streaming now and i'll post videos now

","timestamp":"0:10:12","duration":"3.71","startIndex":8492,"endIndex":8522}],"transcript":"welcome to another JavaScript mini series in this series we're going to be looking at the JavaScript library react j/s alright so I'm not exactly sure how many videos we'll have in the series but in this video we're going to take a look at basically an overview of react and talk about what it is and what it does and why you should use it alright so let's go ahead and start so what is react j/s it's a JavaScript library and it's primarily focused on user interfaces all right it doesn't have any assumptions about the rest of your application as far as models and databases or anything like that it's strictly for the UI it's create it was created and is still maintained by Facebook it's considered the V in MVC and those of you that don't know what MVC is it stands for model view controller so react is the view of MVC all right like I said react makes no assumptions about anything else in your application react can be ran on both the client and on the server alright so you can have an ojs or an express server and you can run react through there as well as well as on the client so react has something called a virtual Dom and this abstracts the Dom away giving you a simple much simpler programming model so it basically creates a slimmer version of the Dom in the browser and it only updates the part parts that need to be rear-ended all right and in turn this makes it much faster when you're dealing with a regular JavaScript application and you want to make some kind of update to the UI the entire page has to refresh the browser refreshes the whole page and that's it with react it can pick and choose which parts it wants to refresh all right and it has a one-way reactive data flow so we have one-way data-binding it's possible to have two-way data-binding if you want to use an add-on I know there's one called react link and there's some other ways that you can get to a data binding so why would you use react well it's simple react manages all of the UI updates for you it's declarative it knows to refresh only the changed parts of the application as opposed to the entire page it's read this is probably the the most beneficial reason it's readable and reusable because everything is considered a component and it's self-contained making it easy to read and to reuse code either in that application or in other applications all right so let's say you have just a regular website and you have a user interface you have the navbar that can be its own component with with its own functions and it's all encapsulated in that component you could have I don't know maybe a SIA sidebar or menu something like that slider whatever it may be a foot or a header you can you can make these into their own components and you can just plug them in wherever you want and you can reuse them in other applications so that's the domain that I think react is so beneficial so react Jas uses something called JSX which is JavaScript syntax extension and this is basically XML or even HTML inside of your react components all right that's what we use to actually present present the markup now using JSX isn't actually required you can use straight JavaScript but it's not recommended for one thing it's it takes a lot longer and it's a lot more code and it's just it's just difficult and not necessary if you can use JSX alright so it's not required but recommended now in order to use JSX we need something to transform that into JavaScript and there's actually some stuff online some utility tools that we can look at that will show us if we type in some JSX it can convert it to JavaScript and show us exactly what it turns into and how it works and we'll take a look at that later but one way to do this is using Babel okay Babel is a JavaScript compiler and it can transform that JSX code for us all right I in addition to that it lets us write code that is lets us write es6 or es2015 syntax all right so it's just a different way to write react components we can we can build classes and the importing files is different and it's just different I wouldn't say that it's better it's just an alternative and we'll take a look at both both ways es5 and es6 but anyways babel will convert the es6 into es5 for the browser alright babel works very well with web pack which is something we'll take a look at it's a module bunda bundler and it also has a really nice dev server that you can use in development now when you're writing JSX inside javascript if you're putting it in your HTML file for instance you'll need to add the type of text slash babel to your script tags alright if you don't do that it's not going to work so here is a very very simple example of a react component all right so what we're doing here is we're creating a component called Hello message all right we're going to set that to react dot create class and then we're going to pass in an object that's going to have all of our functions for that component now the render function will talk about these different lifecycle functions in a second but this is required this is the only one that is required and what that's going to do is it's going to return the component markup this is the JSX oops right here okay you can see we have a div and we're just saying hello and then this right here is a property that we can include in the component all right and then down here this is where we're going to render the component okay so we're going to call react Dom now the latest version of react right now the latest stable version is 0.14 point seven back in version 0.13 you didn't have to do the react Dom all right you could just do react out render but if you're going to use the latest version you can use react on render and then in here we're going to include our hello message component okay this is JSX syntax we have our tag and we're adding an attribute of name setting that to John all right now this is called a property this is a name property we're passing it in and then we're accessing it up here in the component now the way that we get this to actually show on the screen is by this second parameter here where we tell it where to put it okay so we're using just regular JavaScript document dot get element by ID and we're going to pass an app app is going to be the ID of the element where we want to insert this component alright so we'd have in our HTML in our regular HTML we'd have a div with the ID of app and that's where this would show up alright so that's a very simple example and we'll we'll get more into the syntax in the next video so another really important part of react j/s are States States and props or properties alright so components can hold properties or props that can be passed in as attributes and we just saw a good example of that with the hello message and the name we passed in alright components can also maintain an internal state or internal state data alright so you can set States for just about anything objects strings numbers whatever and when a state has changed the component is re-rendered and the mock-up will be updated so this makes react very dynamic alright and to change it we have to call this set state and with if that changes its going to re-render and make all the updates necessary so lifecycle methods are specific methods that are fired off when a component is rendered or updated all right and these are not all of them these are just the more common ones like I said render is the only one that's actually required and that just renders the application just like we just saw all right these other ones here we have get initial state and this is going to allow you to set default values for your state's same thing here we have get default props this will allow you to set defaults for properties component will mount this is a method that's invoked once on the client and server before rendering and then component did mount is going to invoke after the first render all right so you do different things in these different methods and we'll get into this a little later and then we also have react add-ons which are modules that can aid in the development of reactions we have things like animation add-ons we have add-ons to use two-way data-binding such as react link and then we have testing add-ons and as others as well alright so that's going to be it for this video in the next video we'll go ahead and setup a really simple component I'll show you how to to include the JavaScript for react and all that so we'll get into that next all right thanks guys

","timestamp":"0:15:35","duration":"4.43","startIndex":12021,"endIndex":12043}],"transcript":"hey guys this is David Wells doing a react and node tutorial basically running through what isomorphic JavaScript really means isomorphic javascript basically means that you're have one code base that's running on both the client and the server now why would you um do this well with other err front-end frameworks out there like angular ember backbone etc even with react if you're not loading on the server side there is kind of that flash of unstyled content as the Java scripts being piped to the users browser when they're going to that page initially the app is loading up if you render on the server side your Dom nodes and everything are there and once the javascript is piped down to the user the app will work as it should so it's getting rid of that a bad user experience so one of the benefits there would be a better user experience for everyone coming to the site better perceived user experience if I want to clarify that the other thing and this is really the main point for me and why I got interested in this stuff was the search index ability of when you render the your react.js components on the server so when a visitor comes to your site and everything is running through angular or react or whatever and you're not rendering on the server side that search searches and has no idea what your page is about there are third-party services you can pay money for to do that one of them is mentioned in the article here pre-rendered I Oh react actually comes this baked into the library so they thought about server-side rendering as they're building out the library so you can actually compose those Dom nodes on the server side there's a number of different libraries out there like for rails or PHP if you're trying to do server-side rendering with react in this tutorial I'm going to be covering nodejs another kind of benefit of isomorphic javascript is is one your code is like in one place so it's easier for code maintenance and then there's also the concept of basically progressive enhancements and that means if for whatever reason your user has JavaScript turned off in their browser forms can still process if you have those fallback mechanisms when you're loading the you're still loading those dom nodes and what-have-you so if you have a form that's posting somewhere it can still do so as long as it doesn't rely on JavaScript to do so so that's another kind of added benefit to isomorphic JavaScript cool so enough about what it is the demo here today is going to be using a react component library called griddle as you can see here basically it outputs different grids that you can filter through and do whatever but let's say like you're you're running an app and you want this contact content to be indexed by search engines you know and this is served from like a JSON object somewhere so a search engine isn't really gonna index that and serve this up the way that you want and a good example of that would be like Nomad liceo I have no idea what the backend of this is but this is like if I was building this a node and Express and the front end was react I would absolutely want all this stuff to be indexed so when people are searching for different areas and what-have-you that this could actually be served up in Google so I'm not Google just doesn't see a blank page here for example so there is a library here you can find it at the link right here and basically all you got to do is clone it down do an NPM install and then launch the node server and I'm gonna run through the code right now so first things first if we jump into our package JSON file the dev dependencies basically everything is being packaged up with browserify I'm using gulp for this not a huge fan of grunt and no JSX that is what actually does the transpiling of your JSX on the server side so that's a definitely a component that you'll need reacts react tools and react to phi and we're using ejs as the tip living language example here you can use whatever you want i'll show you guys the temp building how that works in a second here and of course express the griddle react library component and this could be done with any react components so you could choose whatever you want the exact same methodologies will apply to your project next thing to look at is the gulp file and this is what is running the packaging of the actual act app scripts but basically it just runs through grabs the main j/s here and packages that down via browserify and then puts that into the public folder with all the different dependencies and what-have-you again you can use grunt and there's many different ways to build a react have a build system set up this is just for this demo so looking at the full project the main entry point is server is where basically we are requiring Express defining that and then this is where the node JSX transfire comes into play so you just require that and install it and that will then allow you to do the node JSX transpiling on the server side and if we actually go and look at the components this is pretty typical of how you would see a component set up where you know here's you have your reacts crate class method the only difference here is when you're trying to render something server side you want to react at create factory and then require that library this is an example of component that I defined myself and the other difference here would be instead of just like having this the way it is and then serving it into the Dom right here you module dot exports that so it can be used elsewhere and if we look in the main one here here we're doing the same exact thing so and again this is the main guess is what gets packaged down and sent to the browser but the react app right here so we're module that exporting it and then in the main J s here we're saying okay require my main module here that is the export create a factory out of it the mount node is specified here as well and if you want to look at the view so if we go to the views under views and index ejs again this is in ejs this could be jade or whatever tempting language handlebars etc that you want to use but here we have our main mount point so going back in here what we do is X tan she ate the class here and then mount the node and this is what gets sent down to the actual build file so the JavaScript so this isn't the server-side rendering component the server-side rendering actually happens in the routes so if we go into routes and core routes what we have here is again the exact same thing so we are saying okay first of all we need react so require react with add-ons then specify the react app cool so we got that again this is from the module that exports in react app KS and then this is just the Express route declaration so on the home page go ahead and create react HTML on the website so react has a super handy method called or to string so basically we're extending that react app as well here not passing you can pass in options here as well option one two three whatever your component actually takes but we're just rendering the base app here and then passing that into our template and there's the react output it's passing in that react HTML so if we go back into the view that's being rendered server-side we can see that variable is being passed in here so the react output is being passed in from the core out here so here is where basically it's transpiling that reacts into the Dom nodes now putting it cool so that is it in a nutshell again the main yes this is the client side stuff so that gets bundled down and put into the main j/s so this is gonna be a rather large file to open because it has the entire react library and all of its dependencies but we'll take a look at that in a second and just to show you that this is working let me go ahead and close this we'll go ahead and go to the folder I'm gonna go ahead and stop the server so did you get the demo running just type in nodes server dot yes and it will run the server at port 444 so if I go in here here's the example so if i refresh the page here is the react rendering and if we want to look at the griddle component real quick so in the react app this is the again we're loading that griddle component and we're creating the factory here so this server knows how to render that server side and then we're just using that component and I'm just using some fake JSON data from the actual demo site so it's saying like okay feed in those that data feed in this column data and the results per page I just set to 100 for this demo because this is and being indexed by search engines cool so and you can see the fake data in the data folder but if we go into the ejs what you can see and if we go and inspect this stuff basically you can see that it has all the you know data react ID stuff in there if we actually go in and so this is our main script so even if this was if I comment to this out the app would still work it just wouldn't be rendering server-side but if I actually comment out the library itself so now that's commented out mean that J s and that's what actually drives the app so I like sorting and what-have-you as we can see there so if i refresh this page none of that stuff works and that's because if we look at the source the actual react code is not loading so if I view the page source you can see but all the data is there and available to be indexed by search engines here is our script commented out I'm gonna go ahead and undo that so I'm going to go ahead and uncomment that out and we'll go look at the demo again and you can see here that now it's back and the react component is mounting all the way so the sort ability and filter ability etcetera from that griddle react component is working and just as a final example we'll go ahead and get rid of the actual variable here so I'll just get rid of this guy save this again and if I go ahead and refresh this page you can see everything still loads I'm running on a local host which is pretty fast so and the data is local so I'm not piping anything down but you can imagine with a larger data set this could present itself as a problem and if we look here you can see that let's take a look at the actual source of the page you page source you can see that there is no content to be indexed by Google and that is because we're no longer injecting that rendered HTML again remember in the routes file or we say ok grab my component and when there certain route is hit go ahead and render that to a string and output that for me so that's basically isomorphic JavaScript in a nutshell you can see why you know this would be bad for search index ability so we'll go ahead and add that back in and then if I go ahead and refresh that source boom there it is everything for Google to ingest and give us more search traffic and that is isomorphic JavaScript in a nutshell sorry for the slightly longer video so now there's really no reason for you not to be rendering your react components server-side again you can do this in PHP or rails or whatever language you're using it's super easy to do a node as I've shown here and in that demo repo for additional isomorphic resources check out the bottom of the post this will be on react news which is an awesome resource I definitely recommend subscribing to them if you are interested in keeping up with the latest and greatest in the react.js community but again at the bottom of the post there's a ton of different server-side react stuff for you to check out including some PHP stuff Rails stuff etc but yeah thanks for watching and tweet me at David Wells if you have any questions but yeah hopefully you can see the power of rendering this stuff server-side if not for the better overall user experience or perceived better user experience but for the search index ability your app if everything's behind the logged in URL or authentication this might not make as much sense but if you do have front-end stuff that you need to de-indexed definitely definitely definitely do this cool

everyone thank you for coming seems like I can't give a talk on one of the coasts without a joke about flyover country but oh oh I'll let you get away with it anyway welcome to react yes and my name is Nick Shrock and I've been an engineer at Facebook for a little over seven years and I was gonna thank the organizers but Brandon took her of that so I'll go recursive thanks Brent and thanks for you know thank you for our guy thanks for thanking organizers and thank you the organizers you know this this conference is really gonna be fantastic I know it's gonna be fantastic because last year's was awesome it actually kind of you know changed the way I really thought about the reactive jazz community but I think to a lot of you on a new face you know I am as you mentioned I'm kind of if anyone if anyone outside of Facebook knows me in this room they probably know me as one of the co careers of graph QL but you know at Facebook I've been working at the core of product engineering for a long time and my job there has essentially been able to build a distractions and frameworks for other product engineers so I'm a Morgan in PHP in hack you know through the beginning of my career and then I also have done projects at the iOS and the Android code bases but I have a confession to make my dad actually code that much JavaScript so when Christopher asked me to do this keynote I was like are you sure you want maybe someone should be up here though it does stuff you know I just I don't code that much JavaScript yeah so you might be asking the question you know what are you what are you doing here huh no what's this guy doing up here and the answer really opened forgot this part you know it could have been anything other people you know Michael Christopher James Sebastian you know here's more people to actually do stuff Jing Ryan Dan neighbor off Pete hunts you know and I think the answer really is that react is much more than a J s library right now it is Jay s library and it's fantastic and originally started to build websites and it does that extremely well and it's a super-important problem but react is becoming an entire ecosystem of technology you know I think as you're watching this develop between react react native flux relay graph QL nuclide flow this is really turning into a cohesive ecosystem that can really fundamentally advance web and mobile development but as I was saying before what is the state of you know react Jay s is incredibly important and a lot of you we're all in this room because we believe in it and so you're gonna hear after me from Ben Alpert about all the stuff we're doing in the core library is super super important there's still a lot of work to do and he's going to talk about how we're gonna address gaps in tooling and also address issues such as JavaScript fatigue but I wanna step back and really take stock of where we're at with react.js and I think all of us at Facebook were originally with the project are really stunned at the breadth the depth and what I like to call the fervor of adoption so let's get into that what do I mean by breadth so I'm not a big believer in talking about github stars as a metric we all love to do that a lot but I prefer this I think this is remarkable the react developer toolkit the plugin for Chrome has nearly 250,000 installed this is for a JavaScript framework that you need to debug or inspect or whatever this is nuts to give you context on that Google Analytics which is one of the foundational technologies the internet that's been around for over a decade only has about 10 to 20 percent 20 per second do math 20% more installs than react I think that's stunning in under three years let's talk about death so it's not like just hobbyists and prototypers even though we love hobbyists and prototypers are using this companies big and small startups household names sports companies media companies technology companies are all betting young react in a huge way I don't know how fast you know adoption has worked in the past but that seems incredible to me under three years and then what do I mean by fervor well I think you can feel the passion about this framework when you go to conferences and meetups such as this and I like to joke around to people outside the community but it almost like feels like a quasi religious event and and we've really taken his next level the office actually someone made a stained-glass window with a react logo and so literally literally we can have a temple to react in the office this is maybe even more of my favorite thing so this is picture of my the CTO Mike's rep for crate guy and he says he's he told us internally when I speak internally the one thing most people want to talk to me about is react now you might not find that that remarkable because we're all super fired up about react but this is the man that oculus reports do that the AI lab reports do as well as the organization that literally builds drones that fly for months on end BB lasers to each other to deliver Internet all over the globe but everyone wants to talk to him about some JavaScript I think that's pretty awesome all right so react.js has been spectacularly successful as a javascript framework but last year we made a huge announcement before last year's conference at react Jay s react was a library for building web you eyes super important problem that's all we got started in this but we announced react native and react change the react project or react native changed the react project from a JavaScript framework to billing you eyes to an entire cohesive web mobile development system right so we have we can build react j/s apps over iOS Android and potentially any other proprietary platform this is an enormous shift and a common reaction I've heard is I've heard this story before of cross-platform mobile platforms it's kind of a weird way of putting that but I've heard this story before and why is it different this time and we fundamentally believe that I actually get a little frustrated when people tell me that because I feel it's a little defeatist but I understand it I understand that engineers skepticism over this and there's this kind of truism right ideas don't work before they work and that might sound stupid but it happens also to be true you know Google was not the first search engine it was about the twenty second search engine or something and you know a lot of you might be a little young to remember this but they're actually you know search ends before duel with all these ridiculous names and none of them worked my favorite was ax Jeeves I think is I'm an Anglophile the whole notion of a butler showing you the Internet it's pretty cute but yeah but the thing is Google is the first awesome search engine and so just because ideas don't work before doesn't mean they're not gonna work in the future so kind of when do these ideas come to fruition and actually execute in the market and I think there's like three elements to that taste you know does doesn't really fit with the people who want to use it and I would say by the fervor we're on target for that timing is the market ready for it is kind of the the world that you're operating ready for this idea and last technology have you made the right technology decisions to execute on your vision and we really think we have that with react so like I said react native part of me and most of stress talks gonna be able route react native react native has react which I think really is an extraordinarily tasteful framework that just aligns to the way developers think developers love this thing mobile devices are ready for a framework like this I don't get into why that is you know and they've changed a lot over the last five years when a lot of these other systems were tried and we're also building what I like to call a horizontal platform we have made different technology decisions and others in the past so let's start react makes react native different and if you've been to one these conferences need overviews you've heard a lot of these buzzwords before immutable data functional programming declarative api's and the virtual Dom now I'm not going to go into all that and try to explain why we think it kind of you know in a kind of a deep philosophical way aligns to the way that computation works right now in the world that we live in but you can kind of feel it when you use the framework because like you just have this kind of like calm zen-like and everything makes sense just a massive advance but what I do want to prove to you or attempt to prove is by example that these concepts are universal actually and they are already working in native development so how I'm gonna do that is actually talk about an iOS framework and it's an iOS framework called component kit so component kit is a UI framework written in objective-c for iOS that adopts similar principles to react to build you eyes and when you ask Adam Ernst who's an incredibly talented iOS engineers the primary author of this you know like hey Adam what were your design parameters and trade-offs and you asked him a fancy engineering question and the response is simple he I stole this shamelessly from react so a trigger warning to all the JavaScript devs out there you're about to look at subject C I know all right so this is a component kit function it returns a bunch of stuff but it has all these crazy shizzle sizzles and insane names and yeah it's just that's how I'm feeling about that but if we start changing things so we rename stuff to look like react native and then we change some symbols all we did was changed some stools in there made it look like some JavaScript added some JSX and then we reformat and we literally have a react function it is the same system ported to iOS it has the same principles it constructs essentially at iOS equivalent of virtual Dom it all works the same way and it's working now this powers our newsfeed and when we change to it's like 4x less code and all the developers are in complete adulation and there's less bugs and you know it's a very familiar story of adoption here you know and this is really I think a differentiator what I mean by taste react has opinions react has values about the way that software should be structured and by building the runtime around that it's really a competitive advantage and will drive adoption and then there's JavaScript so we via JavaScript is a competitive advantage and there's this famous quote by Mark Twain is one of the greatest witnesses every since reports of my death are greatly exaggerated well I think a few other things can make this quote as well one is the desktop the deaths of the desktop is greatly exaggerated and actually I think the person that best captured that and Illustrated that is actually Steve Jobs he makes this great analogy for PCs and laptops PCs are like trucks and what he meant by that is that originally when they first made cars all cars or trucks and then they came out with this little car that most consumers like - way better but there are still trucks on the road like 10 20 % of cars or whatever and they're extremely important to society just like desktops there are certain and tools that mobile devices will probably never be good for at least for the foreseeable future and these tools are incredibly important incredibly incredibly content complex in the same fashion the web is not going anywhere the death of the web is also greatly exaggerated the web is an incredibly important technology it will drive desktop tools and applications for the foreseeable future and mobile web is still really important it is part of our ecosystem so javascript is going nowhere javascript is an awesome language and it's rapidly evolving for someone who's kind of hopping in JavaScript who went pre es6 and then you hop in and go post es6 like oh my god what the hell happened this language is awesome now on the right bind and the lambda syntax and all the rest of it and then you know we're really you know javascript is really pushing in the future one of my favorites is the async await that's come in hopefully in the next standard well here we go because you know we we we have a similar construct in PHP and or half part of me and if you've programmed in this and how to do asynchronous programming which is obviously critical for you eyes it is just incredibly liberating you know and Facebook at least internally what does that mean at least Facebook period is investing in JavaScript heavily so we're committed to supporting and contributing to Babel so obviously our source to source transform flow which is our you know type annotation later to adding code intelligence it's a really powerful gradual typing system for JavaScript and also nuclide which is our IDE that's targeted towards it's kind of assembling all these technology to one cohesive developer experience so what do I mean by the state of mobile devices well an interesting thing has happened in the last five years in that iOS has been dual core since 2011 and Android is even more multi-core you have an Android device in the audience it probably has four cores or more and what's interesting about kind of the the fact you can assume is that multi-core is becoming Universal and what's awesome about react the original designers were very oppresion about this is that the react native architecture is uniquely suited for the multi-core world because whenever you code a react application the product developer doesn't have to think about parallelism but there is a ton of implicit parallelism in the system and that stems from the values of react declarative ap is the immutable data structures which are inherently set thread safe and on and on and on you know and if thinking about you can like extract this is from a very basic architecture diagram every single react native application has the UI main thread both on Android and iOS which is where all the manipulation of platform specific views happen scrolling touch events things of that nature then we have a j/s thread where all the user space JS code is written and then we have a separate thread for computing layout using flexbox you know just kind of the hello world of react native already has implicit parallelism built in that we can take advantage of you know do a lot more work in native given current given the current state of native to take advantage of multi-core so another thing and you've heard this before I sue is that we are not a write once one run anywhere platform and I want to dig into why that is true and the reason why that is true is that proprietary Plateau over there new light react native Club life over there all right the proprietary platforms that we build on will always and forever differentiate and complete and compete right Android iOS Windows Mobile and all the rest of them are completing viciously for market share and users that means they're gonna build different stuff and if you want to deliver native experiences you need to not have write once run anywhere right you're gonna need to write platform specific code and so we kind of coined this phrase learn once write anywhere but I actually don't think that captured the subtlety of what we're doing and the word we're choosing is the horizontal platform so what does that mean well back to our diagram you can think of react native is this thin layer over a relatively thin layer at least relative the OS is over these proprietary os's and you know the the we're not seeking to reimplemented entire OS we're seeking to take advantage of those proprietary capabilities and overlay common tools abstractions and concepts so with the horizontal platform you share one possible and go native when necessary so what do you share well like I said you can share API so there's ton of common API is in react native tools and languages JavaScript the react tool the react chrome developer toolkit etc and it turns out you can actually share a hell of a lot of code not all of it but a ton of it and that unlocks enormous power now when do you have to go native well you have to go native to use the proprietary capabilities of the underlying OS sometimes you need to go to native for compute compute intensive tasks that C++ can execute faster or other native languages and I think this is an incredibly important and subtle point especially as larger software systems adopt react native is that you can preserve your existing investments that you built a native code that are already working any software architecture that proposes that you have to do all at once rewrite all the same time has a much higher barrier much higher activation energy you know and just sometimes you have to get close to the metal now this is one of my favorite tweets of all time yeah in this room that I can maybe you oh you got a drop in to know to get close to the metal right that's not what I'm talking about it's so good you know the reason why is that all abstractions leak this is a fundamental rule of computer science kind of especially distractions with a wide surface area like this you know in react mean if you were going to be developing on iOS or Android the dthe the implementation of the the implementation details of the OSS will undoubtedly leak up different performance problems different bugs so you have to acknowledge this reality even emotionally and accepted and well designed abstractions account for this they allow you to break abstraction in structured ways and and have it be contained and this is one of the key elements of well-designed systems in my view that ensures that they Bend but they don't break you know a lot of these previous systems have been too rigid in the way that they enforce and don't let you drop down into node so how is this actually working so we've built this ads manager app that we've shipped on both iOS and Android and it feels native they share 85 to 90 percent of the code okay that's crazy and they were built by a single team single p.m. same team of engineers okay if you're in software engineering management or product management and you're not like physically shaking I don't think you understand the information that was just communicated to you yeah if you're not impressed by this I literally give up so what's next for react so you know I hate to disappoint some of you but we do not have an announcement on the scale of react native this year I apologize we laid out an ambitious and huge vision last year and it's going to take a long time to execute on it both you and us together so essentially in summary we have three priorities in 2016 first priority is execution the second priority is execution and the third priority is execution we are relentlessly executing on this vision and there's kind of like this common Silicon Valley cliche that ideas are easy an execution is everything and the frustrating things about cliches if they're more than often true this is one of them that's true you know it's much harder to assemble a team and define that timing and taste and technology to get makes something work properly and that's what we've been doing this entire year so react native on Android was released this year we are releasing production apps on react native both the ads manager that previously mentioned as well as our group's app which is largely built on react native they are both on iOS and Android yeah we are expanding the ecosystem around react native both with libraries like relay and graph Qi which embodies similar concepts to react native on the server side we are using react native in the Facebook main application we released this thing called the friends day video where you get to make them it's actually a fairly complicated UI and you have to you get to make a video for your friends and like butterflies fly in and whatever but this this feature was also build by one team shipped on iOS and Android on react native and we are also beginning to move permanent features in the app to react native we're in the process of rolling out the events dashboard which is actually a very highly used UI element or feature in our app that will be react native before you know it and then we are working on improving the runtime we are doing it relentlessly you're gonna hear a talk them to do about the performance work that's happening there is a ton of work and if you kind of follow the repo and watch the upstreams happen it is a relentless pounding to improve performance you know performance is one of the things just one foot in front of the other because just a lot of hard work and there's generally no easy wins once the low-hanging fruit is gone and they've done a ton of impressive work react native adoption within Facebook engineering is accelerating in 2006 our goal is to move react native into the very heart of the Facebook consumer experience and that means we will just be investing more and more and more into react native and open sourcing more and more and more improvements and that's good for all of us we want to get the same dynamic that we have in reactive the self-sustaining community but someone has to lead the way and we're gonna make it so it can ship and the most used app in the world last thing I want to talk about what react native means to the industry so if we're successful we are really on the cusp of redefining mobile development and you know we are in the midst of this mobile revolution it's the biggest shift in consumer technology probably since the internet or the web and you have billions of people around the world with these supercomputers in their pocket that it can connect just you know social communication and economic networks it's crazy how much these things are redefining these parts of our lives and so it's been a giant leap forward for consumers but because the consumers for their high use apps have demanded native experiences it's actually been a huge step backwards for developers and product organizations so just put this in historical context we started with desktop development and with desktop development you were developing on proprietary platforms like Windows Mac's lares and others you had installed binaries so if you shipped a bug it would exist in the field for years and that made you much more cautious slowdown development times and then let's talk about compile cycles in any native code base of large size I don't know how many of you have worked in like a large C++ or Java god you are also lucky I mean it is awful it is literally awful you like press compile and you wait ten minutes you're like question your career just dude career choices and then you have to build these organizations that have platform aware teams meaning platform is an input and how you organize yourselves so then you have like two different teams or different platforms you have to spend all this time with communication overhead and make sure everyone likes each other and that you have the same product roadmap and all the stuff and it's a huge pain really slows down the entire development process web was not just a revolution for the consumer and it was but web was also revolution for the way that software organizations operate and instead of these proprietary standards you got open standards that means you had a more ecosystem a better ecosystem of tools you didn't have vendor lock-in you had instant distribution which is so empowering for organizations you can fix bugs instantly you can experiment you can improve things much much more quickly continuous deployment all this stuff fast iteration now when you're developing you get this flow right you guys know what I'm talking about and it's so much better than the way for a compile cycle and then you can haveyou can fundamentally organize your companies differently while delivering to more and more users you can have a single product team a single PM or person to authoring features you can synchronize your features your launch schedule it completely changes the operational rhythm of a company moving from web to native was effectively like being ripped back in time and like not in like a really fun way it's like you're going back to some time that wasn't good you know and really the react native opportunity is our opportunity goes back to the future and the it truly is symmetrical from native you're going to proprietary platforms to open standards and react native or open source maybe it has to be formalized later you're going from install binary see instant distribution potentially systems like code push or exponent these other people are working on this you're going from compile cycles to fast iteration going from platform aware teams to unified teams okay it's amazing react native can transform product organizations it's not just your experience in front of the computer right this is a big deal lastly I just kind of want to put all of Facebook's effort in context you know I've been talking about the ecosystem and all these related technologies and we like to say that the whole of these is greater than the sum of their parts each of these projects react native react flow graph QL etc are all useful in your own right you can integrate them into systems but together they actually fit together they are all lined philosophically you know graph qo is another horizontal platform I kind of liken it to react native in a way on the server and what I mean by that is as it's thin layer of an open standard that can be implemented in any language which is particular to the needs of your application and also any back-end right so it's kind of like two horizontal platforms stacked on top of each other and if you go all-in on this philosophy the results can be incredible right that's the power of relay it is a coupling of react to graph QL and if you really fully buy into this it's just just amazing product experience you have the queries co-located with the fuse and it's amazing I wish I had more time to actually like explain what these are but 30 minutes is 30 minutes and then you have systems like flux and Redux all right the eg section could go on like for about 30 slides I think right but you know this is these are other systems and philosophies which totally just fit in right they all click they all fit together and so you know as we move forward and mature this ecosystem I like I said before I really do think we're on the cusp of completely redefining what it means to develop mobile applications and while we're doing that because of the way this is all structured with components that fit together it doesn't mean you have to abandon the previous stuff by improving react native you're improving reaction yes and vice versa right this is amazing journey we're all gonna be on and so without further ado I want to pass it on to Ben Alpert who's gonna talk about the developments have happened in the react.js library and I'm really excited for this and you know thank you for having me

downloaded zip file you will see like one folder react with the latest version you are looking at double click on this you will see build inside build you will see like five different JavaScript files and out of this you need to to get started the react dot min dodges and j sx transformer now i would like to copy these to wherever i want to write my code so i will go to in my documents i will create a folder say react try and inside react try i will just drag this to file we will create our HTML file at the same location where we have these two javascript by using a text editor and i would be using sublime text in here i will create an HTML file and will save it in the same location by giving it a name first dot HTML and here we'll get the react library dayak dot MnDOT Jas and the second script will get the transformer and we have J as extras former dot J s all my JavaScript to huge react GS would be the next script block and in this script block I have to tell browser that I would be using a special type of script and name of the script would be text / j sx and we will talk more about j sx later to create the first component i will give it as a name like variable and name

create a component in react j/s to see this react component on your webpage you have to do two things first thing is you have to have a dom elements where you want to show this component so we will create a dom elements here and we will simply create a div and i will give an ID would be my div and here we will call react dot render and first thing we have to pass is the component in an HTML tag we will create the enclosing and pass my component meses close this tag and second parameter i have to pass the elements where I want to put this component so we can simply call this deep by using document dot get element by ID pass my deal and that's all we need to do to create our first component we will save it and go to the folder where I have first dot HTML and we'll double-click it to

guys so in my last video I gave you guys a basic introduction to react and we spoke about a lot of high-level concepts and about 50% of the video was a slide deck but hopefully you guys found that helpful um and have a basic understanding of what react is and why it's important and why it's being used in a lot of production applications today but today what I'm going to do is I'm gonna put out a 10 part video series to go through each individual step of installing a react app so in the in the last video we threw together like a really quick hello world we're gonna go a little bit farther than hello world on this one but as I mentioned I'm gonna break it up into small bits and pieces that are very digestible so that you understand every single component that we build along the way um so I'm gonna go ahead and just start a new repo for this react in ten steps and I'm gonna leave a link to this codebase in the description in case you guys want to follow along awesome so now that I have my repo I'm gonna go ahead and clone this into my project folder awesome so now as you guys see I have a completely empty project and once again we're gonna make a react app from scratch so first things first I'm gonna run NPM on it I'm just gonna hit enter to go through all the defaults all right now if we go back to the documentation from the last project see we need to MPM install react and npm install react dom now react and react dom have actually been separated recently so react and react on were one thing react deals more with components and react Dom deals with rendering those components into a web document and I believe that the reason that they are extracting the two is that react is kind of the engine for rendering and react Dom deals more with interfacing with HTML and now that react is being used for native mobile applications with react native they want to be able to create the interface to interface with all sorts of devices and not just um web browsers so next up we're going to install dev dependencies and like we spoke about in the last video dev dependencies are used on your development environment but they're not necessarily required in production so gonna install a web pack that will core the loader gavel preset for react that will preset for es2015 and we're gonna add the flag of - - save for death now that we have this all up and running let's take a look in our app folder and see what we created so now we have known modules no modules has a lot of libraries that are going to be required to build the project and the meat and potatoes what we really care about is package dot JSON and this is the blueprint to our node project so let's go ahead and take a closer look into the package JSON file as I mentioned this is the blueprint to your project so first up we have the name the description the version number and a set of scripts that can be pre-programmed to run at certain times right now we just have a test script but if I wanted to add a run script or a start script I would add start and then I would add what we want to happen now this portion of the file this top portion was created during the MPM init process we were asked for our name a description of our project the version of our project and the author of our project second section are the dev dependencies now the dev dependencies were installed when we ran NPM install - - save dev and MPM install - - save so we have bable bable core we have some babel presets we have another package called concurrently and then we have wet pack but wait where's react so unfortunately when I was installing the scripts actually forgot to save react so if we look at node modules react is gonna be there so here's react and react Dom they are there but unfortunately since I didn't save them they're not saved to my blueprint for the next developer and that's bad we want the next developer to have react in their project if they clone it so if we run npm install react and react Dom and we add the flag of - - save this is going to install the two packages but in addition to that it's going to save them into our package dot JSON file so that when the next developer downloads your package and runs NPM install the packages are there for the next developer as you can see the dependencies of reactive reactant have been added to the file from the NPM command line so that's how you install react with NPM in our next video we're going to jump into creating web pack configuration files to compile our react code stay tuned

interfaces for web a typical HTML page or it could also include a mobile experience on iOS or Android devices reiax framework has been written in JavaScript language react was developed by a developer named Jordan at Facebook in 2011 later facebook open sourced it in 2013 at a react.js conference in u.s. the language is declarative you can describe the elements using a tremor like syntax react some people also views react as V in MVC MVC stands for Model View controller and V represents view inside MVC if you do not know MBC pattern don't worry there is not a prerequisite to know about MVC if you want to learn about react react does one thing and one thing very nicely it's exclusively used to describe a visual appearance of a user interface elements and dynamic interaction with the user and it does that really really well react is modular in nature you can create components in react and you can next components within each other you can next component you can nest one component with another component you could also reuse the component same component in several views that's why react is very reusable and you can reuse the component that you have created again and again so just to give you an example what you see on the screen is basically a friendless and that friend list consists of many different components so these are different components it consists of a friend list and the friendless intern consists of a friendless item which shows it is friendless is basically friend list is a collection of friendless item friend list item consists of fatal in this item represents each row on the screen and each friendless item consists of a picture of a friend then the name of the friend the number of friends he has and also a verification button whether they are whether we are still friends with this person or not inside friend this item there is another element called friend list info which is this part which consists of just friend name and the number of elements and the number of friends friend list item again consists of another react element which is called friend info friend info consists of the name of the friend and the number of friends it has in addition to the friend info friend list item also consists of the picture of a friend and also a boolean flag which indicates whether he is friends with me or not so this is a visual appearance of a react view and the way you describe that in a webpage is a similar XML like syntax you basically describe a Friendly's item and inside when this you basically have a friendly friend list at the top inside Sendas you have a collection of this friend list item and you have their attributes like picture URL and inside friend�s items you have again the friend info M so as you can see a very complex view can be easily refactored into the individual react components and you can describe that is using a declarative language as you can see on the screen now these again react each of these elements is a custom react component which we can create using a JavaScript and this this core each of this component like friendly sytem our friend info could be reused in several other screen in case you are wondering why to use react at all you have come to the right place you might be wondering I am already using HTML to create the web pages I have been using frameworks like angular or ember or knockout in addition to my HTML to create the dynamic HTML elements so why should I use react at all so this particular lecture will try to address that question first of all react is free it has been open sourced by Facebook so you can just download and start using in your application without paying a dime to use react all you need to know is JavaScript which most of the developers already know so you don't need to need you don't need to learn a new language you just need to understand the react library which is already written in JavaScript also these days as you might be knowing we can also use JavaScript on the server side a lot of frameworks like no just a lot of frameworks like node.js that are available where you can write a server-side applications in pure JavaScript so you have the JavaScript is becoming very popular and it's very useful at the full-stack application developer skill using javascript these days you can write web client as well as the web server application also if you know react you can also there's also a special version of react called react native using which you can also build the mobile application in ios and android so as you can see you can use react to build camp web application on the client-side web application on the server side and also mobile applications so this will really give you an edge over other developers because knowing react and JavaScript you become a full stack developer full-stack developer basically is the developer who's capable of developing client-side applications as well as the service and application and also mobile application this skills are very rare these days so if you have JavaScript skills along with react you have definitely a very bright future react also has much better performance as compared to other JavaScript frameworks like angular and amber so I have a slide for you to showcase how the performance of a react is better as compared to the other JavaScript frameworks so who's using network react these days so ever since Facebook open source reacting to the 2013 Facebook internally is using it for this chat application in addition to the Facebook a lot of other big companies like Netflix Yahoo Instagram New York time can Academy and also Airbnb uses react in all of their applications so that's a testimonial to the popularity of the react app reacts framework and that's why it's becoming more and more popular in addition to react there are two other libraries available from Facebook graph QL and relay graph QL is very useful for writing queries that you can use to fetch the data from the server in a declarative way and relay is basically a glue that blues between the query and the server so using the react graph QL and relay you can really build a very powerful web applications which are highly performant at highly scalable having said that to use react you don't need to know graph QL and really you can use react without graph QL and remain I will be publishing new courses on graph QL and relay in your future and then I will send an announcement and then you can take those courses as well you react performance is very very better than other commonly used JavaScript frameworks like angular and embarq Ryan Florence from Facebook as demonstrated in react.js conference 2015 basically he has demoed an application which monitors TB the same application has been developed in ember angular and react so as you can see in the demo there are three different key screens one on the left is a demo built using ember the one in the middle with the demo built using angular and the one on the right is the demo built using react so as you can see the performance and the memory the memory footprint of amber on the left it keeps on climbing so there is a memory leakage in the member and also the memory of angular is comparable to the memory footprint of react now as you can see the performance wise the react application is responding a lot faster as compared to angular and imbel also the responsiveness of the app that is when when a mouse is hovered over a particular link the react responds a very better way instantaneously as compared to ember and angular so this demonstrates basically the performance of react app is great way better as compared to ember and angular ","relevantScore":-0.0028676771814829987}}]
